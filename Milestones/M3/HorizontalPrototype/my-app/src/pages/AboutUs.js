      <h1>About Us: Our Mission</h1>
        <p>ULingual is a language exchange platform that connects native speaker with non-native speakers of a given language.
           Users at ULingual can learn and practice speaking a language with each other over a video streaming connection 
           to experience a more personal and intriguing learning experience.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>ULingual understands that learning language can be difficult.
          Practicing by speaking is an important component of learning. 
          At ULingual we also believe in practice by hearing, getting adjusted to a language by hearing it is a great way of learning.
          This is why at ULingual we offer curated music playlists, movies & show recommendations, and boook recommendations
          to further create a more unique learning experience.
         </p>
         <br></br>
         <p>What makes ULingual stands out from the rest lies in our alternative learnng methods.
           Speaking the language is only half the battle, learning by hearing and recognizing phrases
           and sayings from the language is the other half.</p>
         <br></br>
         <p>Here at ULingual we believe it is critical to immerse yourself in the language by getting
           involved with its culture, whether through music, books, movies, or television.</p>
         <br></br>
