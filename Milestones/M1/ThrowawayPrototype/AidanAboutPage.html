		<h2> About Me: </h2>

    	<p> 
			My name is Aidan Stivers. I'm 23 years old
			<br>
			I am a student at SFSU, majoring in Computer Science.
			<br>
			I find that I take more easily to the math and theory of computer science more than the programming but I enjoy learning about both.
			<br>
			I enjoy drinking coffee and seeing interesting architecture.
			<br>
			My favorite hobby is portrait photography but I haven't been doing much of that recently since COVID. 
			<br>
			My preferred medium of entertainment are movies and TV shows.
			<br>
			I basically like everything to do with cameras.
